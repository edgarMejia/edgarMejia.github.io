As I used open source resources for the creation of this site, feel free to use it as a base or as part of your own projects.

## Page based on:
- Repo: https://github.com/panr/gatsby-starter-hello-friend
- Demo: https://gatsby-hello-friend.now.sh/

## Cards design
Part of my attempt to create blog-like entries on my personal page.

## Footer
It seems simple, but leaving the footer fixed at the bottom of the page was the biggest challenge I encountered.
